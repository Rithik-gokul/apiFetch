Created a navbar with react logo and <button> element 
using useEffect with fetch I got data from the API and since I used useeffect there no infinite rendering 
I used useState store data from API , TO know if API data is fetched on not (Loading) and for clicked function So I can show data when button is clicked
I created Component.jsx to style data in card format 
I used map() to create multiple componets using the data from API in Component.jsx style 
I used conditional rendering to check if button is clicked and for knowing if data is fetched as it shows loading until then
